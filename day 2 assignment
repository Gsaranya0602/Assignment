1. What are Primitive and Non-Primitive Datatypes?
    Primitive Data types:
       premitive data types are build in java and stores single value
       eg: int,short,byte

Non-Primitive Datatypes:
Non premitive data types are not predefined in java and stores referense to object.
  eg: string,array


2. I have a number 500 which needs to be stored in a variable. Which datatype you need to choose and why?

    i have choose int.
    because int is faster and default choice for whole numbers.
   int datatype is most commonly used. 
  shall we use short (data type) but it is used rarly for low memory purpose.
